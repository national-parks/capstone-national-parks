<Br>
	<p>Tony wanted to visit our website to find some resources before he on a long road trip of camping.
	He's tried other sites but he could never find the information that he needed.</p>
	<P>He is planning to travel from Taos, NM, through Colorado and up to Wyoming and visit the Yellow Stone National Park.
	So, He would like to see where else he may be able to visit on his route.</P>
